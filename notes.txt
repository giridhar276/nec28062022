*** Everything in python is object***


objects
-------


number
------
number can be integer or decimal or octal or hexa.

val = 10
aval = 34.3

string
--------
string is defined in single or double or triple quotes.

aname = 'python programming'
bname = "testing"
cname = """java programing"""



list
-------
list contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
list elements are defined in [].

alist = [10,20,30,343,10,10,10]
blist = ["java programming","python",'unix']


tuple ( immutable  unchangable uneditable )
-------
tuple contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
tuple elements are defined in ().
***** Elements inside tuple cannot be modified DIRECTLY*****


atup = ('java',34,45.43)


dictionary ( json )
----------
dictionary contains elements in key:value pairs
dictionary elements are defined in {}.
keys are used to uniquely identify the value.it can be either number or string.
value can be number or string or list or tuple or dictionary or set or any other complex data structure.

syntax:    object = { key:value , key:value , key:value ...}
example:    book  = {"chap1":10  ,"chap2":20 ,"chap3":30 ,"chap1":100 }
            book  = {"chap1":[10,"Rita",'US']  ,"chap2":[20,'Arthur','UK'] }
            data = {1:2,3:4}






set
-----
set is unordered collection of unique values of the same type.


aset = {10,10,20,30,30,20}





working with flat files ( txt conf csv log .... )

working with third party files ( we need some third party software like MS Office or adobe reader to open files)
-----------------------
.doc   pptx  .pdf   .mpeg





package | module | library
-----------------------------
Every library contains set of methods.



exception handling
------------------

- syntax error
- semantic error or runtime error


-------------------------------
Handling the exception in the runtime is known as exception handling

try
except
else
finally


packages | library | module |
----------------------------------

- builtin libraries
-----------------------
all the builtin libraries( around 8000 packages with anaconda) which are generally used(math operations , OS level operations , email handling , string operations , copying ) are installed with python 

- third party libraries
-----------------------
Depending on the requirement( excel operations , machine learning , image processing , db operations , cloud operations ) developer has to install the third party library from


- www.pypi.org    ( downloading and installing manually)
- using pip tool  (  pip install libraryname)
                  (  pip install pymysql)
